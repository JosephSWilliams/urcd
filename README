URCd:
 The most private, secure, open source, "Internet Relay Chat" style chat
 network. The contents are softwares providing URC, an IRC-like protocol,
 by providing a means to easily create, connect, and/or bridge existing URC
 networks, where IRC clients might connect and chat among one another in an
 IRC like environment, with a simple, evolved protocol, engineered for personal,
 and secure communications, that is possible through a decentralized
 peer-to-peer network by using advanced cryptographic techniques, with a simple
 interface. 

depends:
 NaCl or libsodium, libtai, ucspi-tcp,
 python(>=2.6), python-dev(>=2.6),
 daemontools, sh, gcc

recommends:
 NaCl instead of libsodium,
 cython(>=0.18.0)

todo:
  consider crypto modes for cryptoserv

  implement ban/except for clients without regex ignore.

  add a global hostmask option for users sending messages into
  urc from an ircnet for urc2sd.

  implement presence notifications for the ircd side in urc2sd.

  add encrypted channels to urc2sd.

install:
  # install dependencies, if you haven't already:
   ./install-daemontools.sh
   ./install-ucspi-tcp.sh
   ./install-libtai.sh

  # recommended over ./install-libsodium.sh:
   ./install-nacl.sh

  useradd urcd

  # OpenBSD:
   echo '-ftrampolines' > conf-cc

  # if python2.6:
   sed 's/\.7/.6/g' Make.sh | sh -v

  # elif python2.7
  ./Make.sh

  # edit the network/hostmask
  $editor env/serv

  # edit the motd
  $editor env/motd

  ln -s `pwd` /service/urcd

  echo "`pwd`/urc.db" > env/URCDB
  svstat /service/urcd

CryptoServ (requires NaCl):
  ln -s stdin.cryptoserv stdin

hub2hub:
  ### create your urchub, you only need to do this once
  test -e /services/urcd-hub0/ || ./bin/add-urchub

  ./bin/add-hublisten your.urcd.ano 6789 /service/urcd-hub0/socket/

   ### add peers. i recommend three
  ./bin/add-hubconnect peer.urcd.ano 6789 /service/urcd-hub0/socket/

no censorship (security):
  URC networks are censorship resistant. i
  recommend URCSIGN and/or URCCRYPTOBOX to
  ignore spam and trolls. URCd will replace
  the user field with VERIFIED for users with
  valid authentication or signature verification.
  All other user fields will be replaced with
  URCD. e.g.:

  nick!URCD@server
  nick!VERIFIED@server

  irssi ("ban/except"):
    /ignore *!*@* ALL
    /ignore -except friend!*@* ALL
    /ignore -except *!VERIFIED@* ALL

  xchat ("ban/except"):
    /ignore *!*@* ALL
    /ignore friend!*@* ALL UNIGNORE
    /ignore *!VERIFIED@* ALL UNIGNORE

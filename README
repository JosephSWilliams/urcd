URCd:
 10,000 genomes of human lizard hybrid soldiers being sent server to server
 between Angola and Luxembourg with some 70's style casual sex peering
 arrangement.

 if you want a real description view doc/*

depends:
 NaCl or libsodium, libtai, ucspi-tcp,
 python(>=2.6), python-dev(>=2.6),
 daemontools, sh, gcc

 your clock needs to be as reasonably accurate, possibly by using something like
 ntp, otherwise your messages could be dropped from the network.

recommends:
 NaCl instead of libsodium,
 cython(>=0.18.0)

install:
 # install dependencies, if you haven't already:
 ./install-daemontools.sh
 ./install-ucspi-tcp.sh

 # URCd with ssl.
 # if you actually get it to work let me know :-/
 # depends on openssl, libssl-dev, perl, libperl-dev
 ./install-ucspi-ssl.sh

 # this also patches libtai for 64-bit shared objects
 ./install-libtai.sh

 # recommended over ./install-libsodium.sh:
 ./install-nacl.sh

 # OpenBSD:
 echo '-ftrampolines' > conf-cc

 ./Make.sh

 # edit the network/hostmask
 $editor env/serv

 # edit the motd
 $editor env/motd

 ln -s `pwd` /service/urcd

 echo "`pwd`/urc.db" > env/URCDB
 svstat /service/urcd

 ### create your urchub, you only need to do this once
 ./scripts/add-urchub

CryptoServ:
 ln -s stdin.cryptoserv stdin

hub2hub:
 ./scripts/add-hublisten local.urc.example.tld 6789 /service/urcd-hub0/socket/

 ### add peers. i recommend between 2 and 4 at the most
 ./scripts/add-hubconnect remote.urc.example.tld 6789 /service/urcd-hub0/socket/

no censorship (security):
 URC networks are censorship resistant. i recommend URCSIGN and/or URCCRYPTOBOX
 to ignore spam and trolls. URCd will replace the user field with VERIFIED-Nick
 for users with valid authentication or signature verification. All other user
 fields will be replaced with URCD-Nick. e.g.:

 Nick!URCD-Nick@server
 Nick!VERIFIED-Nick@server

 irssi ("ban/except"):
  /ignore *!*@* ALL
  /ignore -except friend!*@* ALL
  /ignore -except *!VERIFIED-*@* ALL

 xchat ("ban/except"):
  /ignore *!*@* ALL
  /ignore friend!*@* ALL UNIGNORE
  /ignore *!VERIFIED-*@* ALL UNIGNORE

Thanks:
 Thank you for using URCd. If you appreciate this project, please consider
 running a public URC hub, or sending a small donation. Like other darknets,
 URC is a stronger, safer network the more people that actively participate
 in building reliable nodes. Small donations help me financially, thus giving
 me more time to focus on this project.

You probably don't know how much you helped the URC network grow.
you're were a great hacker, a great person, with a lot of heart.
As much as i probably didn't show it you were my friend. I
don't know where you are now, but I hope you're in a good place
wherever that might be. You're missed. you were and always will be
one of the greatest and truest soldiers of real freedom. You're
not replaceable. Thanks for everything you've done. much love to
you wherever you may be. - d3v11

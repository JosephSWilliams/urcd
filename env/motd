"I have tried everything from voting petitions to peaceful
protest and have found that those in power do not want the
truth to be exposed. When we speak truth to power we are
ignored at best and brutally suppressed at worst. We are
confronting a power structure that does not respect its own
system of checks and balances, never mind the rights of it’s
own citizens or the international community." - Jeremy Hammond

"Information is power. But like all power, there are those who
want to keep it for themselves. The world’s entire scientific
and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and
journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a
handful of private corporations." - Aaron Swartz

"Ten years ago it would have been infeasible for tens of
thousands of individuals with no physical connection or
central leadership to conceive, announce, and implement a
massive act of civil disobedience against a significant
Western power, crippling a portion of its online
infrastructure in the process - and to do all of this in a
matter of days, and without anyone involved having to contend
with the tear-gas-and-horseback response with which states
have traditionally been in the habit of contending with mass
action. But such a thing as this is happening today, and having
been done once will almost certainly be done again - repeatedly,
increasingly, and with potentially significant consequences for
the nation-state and implications regarding that which will
perhaps someday come to replace it." - Barrett Brown

"I have tried everything from voting petitions to peaceful
protest and have found that those in power do not want the
truth to be exposed. When we speak truth to power we are
ignored at best and brutally suppressed at worst. We are
confronting a power structure that does not respect its own
system of checks and balances, never mind the rights of it’s
own citizens or the international community." - Jeremy Hammond

"Information is power. But like all power, there are those who
want to keep it for themselves. The world’s entire scientific
and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and
journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a
handful of private corporations." - Aaron Swartz
